# Dev Team

## Guidelines for Probees:

{: .important-title }
>
- **Demo Project**: Depending on the tech stack (Frontend/Backend) you're good at, you are required to either present a previously completed demo project or create a new demo project using the relevant technologies within a probation period of 4-6 weeks, Refer to the [Skills Certification and Project Development for Probees](#skills-certification-and-project-development-for-probees) section for more detailed infomation related to demo project.
- **Standup Calls**: Attend the standup calls daily. If you cannot attend, inform the team ahead of time in the `#team-unavailability` channel.
- **Task Updates**: Upon completing the demo project, report your progress during the daily standup meeting and post those updates in `#task-updates` channel.
- **Real-time Project Onboarding**: Once you have completed, the demo project is reviewed, then based on your performance and activity you will be onboarded to the real-time project .
- Please ensure adherence to these guidelines to facilitate a smooth and productive internship experience.

### **Skills Certification and Project Development for Probees:**

1. **Git Certification**: Complete the Git course  Free [Git Course Powered by IBM]({{ site.external_source.git_course_by_ibm }}) (proceed with free course instead of certification).

2. **Project Development**: Based on the specialization you're working on, please refer to the links below to see the guidelines of project development related to your specialization.
     1. [Frontend Developer (UI Specialist)](/docs/teams/01-dev-team/04-ui-developer/#project-development-guidelines-for-probees)
     2. [Backend Developer (API Specialist)](/docs/teams/01-dev-team/05-api-developer/#project-development-guidelines-for-probees)

## Dev Onboarding Tasks

Once you've onboarded to the real-time project, you must complete the following tasks:

1. Download the Discord app on both your mobile device and computer.
2. Setup the Development Environment by following the steps provided [here](/docs/teams/01-dev-team/01-env-setup-kt-videos/#development-environment-setup)
2. Obtain access to the UI and API repositories from the Dev Tech Leads.
3. Follow the README file in both repositories and set them up on your local machine.
4. Run both repositories and ensure they are working correctly.
5. Set up SSH keys for your machine on your GitHub account. If you are unsure how to do this, look up instructions and follow them.
6. Checkout the knowledge transfer (KT) videos [here](/docs/teams/01-dev-team/01-env-setup-kt-videos/#kt-videos).


## Protocols to follow for the Dev Team

1. **Task Updates**: You should update your task progress in the `#task-updates` channel.
2. **Posting Issues**: If you're encounter any issue or facing any troubles please post in the `#troubleshooting` channel.
