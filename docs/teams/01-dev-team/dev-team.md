# Dev Team

{: .important-title }
> Dev Team Guidelines
- Depending on the team assignment, you are required to either present a previously completed demo project or create a new demo project using the relevant technology for that team. The technologies we work with include Git, Docker, Redis, GraphQL, D3.js, Nginx, Novu, Celery, Jenkins, CI/CD pipelines, Postgres, Flutter, and Expo, React. Kubernetes Grafana, AWS, Sonar Qube.
- Upon completing the demo project, report your progress during the daily standup meeting.
- After your demo project is reviewed and approved, you will be granted access to the GitHub repository for the real-time project.
- Once you have access to the GitHub repositories, you will be able to assign tasks from the GitHub issues list.
- Please ensure adherence to these guidelines to facilitate a smooth and productive internship experience.

## Protocols to follow for the Dev Team

1. **Task Updates**: You should update your task progress in the `#task-updates` channel.
2. **Posting Issues**: If you're encounter any issue or facing any troubles please post in the `#troubleshooting` channel.

# Example Markdown file

Check out [Google]({{ site.external_links.google }}) or visit our [GitHub]({{ site.external_links.github }}).

## Probation Rules:

1. **Git Certification**: Complete the Git course  - <a href="https://www.edx.org/learn/github/ibm-git-and-github-basics" target="_blank">Free Git Course Powered in IBM </a> (proceed with free course instead of certification)

2. **Standup Calls**: Attend the standup calls daily. If you cannot attend, inform the team ahead of time in the `#team-unavailability` channel.

3. **Demo Project**: Develop a demonstration project within a probation period of 4-6 weeks, focusing on the following functionalities based on your assigned team. Refer to the [tutorials](#tutorials) section for resources related to the respective technologies.

    - **Frontend**

        - Develop an _Expo_ project incorporating the following functionalities:
            1. Implement an Audio/Visual interface using GetStream.io.
            2. Integrate in-app notifications.
            3. Establish basic API integrations.

    - **Backend**

        - Develop a _Django API_ project utilizing GraphQL, including:
            1. Implementation of basic queries.
            2. Implementation of mutations.

4. **Real-time Project Onboarding**: Once you have completed developing the demo project, you will be onboarded to the real-time project based on your performance and activity.

## Dev Onboarding Tasks

If you are joining the Vivada Tech team as a developer with the goal of becoming a capable full-stack developer, you must complete the following tasks:

1. Download the Discord app on both your mobile device and computer.
2. Obtain access to the UI and API repositories from the Dev Tech Leads.
3. Follow the README file in both repositories and set them up on your local machine.
4. Run both repositories and ensure they are working correctly.
5. Set up SSH keys for your machine on your GitHub account. If you are unsure how to do this, look up instructions and follow them.
6. Watch the knowledge transfer (KT) videos linked below.

## Terms

As you work in the team, you will need to be familiar with these terms to be effective. You don't need to be an expert, but you should understand their functions and why we use them in our project:

1. Git
2. Git pull, push, merge, commit, stage, stash
3. Create merge request (create pull request)
4. Docker, Docker Compose, Docker services
5. Redis
6. Caching (client-side vs server-side)
7. GraphQL
8. Package.json
9. npm script
10. Netlify
11. Capacitor package
12. D3.js
13. Environment variables
14. Nginx
15. Novu
16. Celery
17. Jenkins
18. CI/CD pipelines
19. Postgres
20. Kubernetes
21. Grafana
22. Sonar Qube
23. AWS
