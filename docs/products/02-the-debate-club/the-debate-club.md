# The Debate Club (TDC)


[The Debate Club](https://thedebateclub.info/) strives to encourage respectful dialogue among individuals or groups with diverse opinions. It can be challenging to facilitate civil discussions between contrasting viewpoints, as people tend to align with those sharing their views due to a natural aversion to disagreement. The clubâ€™s mission is to establish a setting that simplifies the process of conducting consistent, respectful, and civil debates on contentious topics, welcoming all perspectives.
