# Agile Methodology

## Objective
The aim of the company is to adopt Agile Methodology to improve project management efficiency, enhance team collaboration, and deliver high-quality products promptly.

### How does this benefit us?

- **Flexibility** : Quickly adapt to changes and new information.
- **Collaboration**: Foster better teamwork and understanding.
- **Faster Delivery**: Deliver valuable features more frequently.
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Ensure the final product meets or exceeds expectations.

## SCRUM Framework

### How SCRUM Works
- **Product Backlog** contains a dynamic list of requirements in the form of User Stories.
- **Sprint Backlog** will have committed backlogs to be completed in that sprint.
- Each Sprint is time-boxed for 2-4 weeks.
- Scrum projects make progress in a series of “sprints”.
- A Sprint has a mini SDLC which may include design, coding, and testing.
- Each Sprint release will have incremental potentially shippable deliverables.

### SCRUM Roles
- **Product Owner**
- **Scrum Master**
- **Scrum Team**

### Responsibilities of the Product Owner
- Define the features of the product
- Decide on release date
- Be responsible for the profitability of the product (ROI)
- Prioritize features according to market value
- Adjust features and priority every sprint, as needed
- Accept or reject work results

### Responsibilities of the SCRUM Master
- Represent management to the project
- Enact Scrum values and practices
- Remove impediments
- Ensure that the team is fully functional and productive
- Enable close cooperation across all roles and functions
- Shield the team from external interferences

### Responsibilities of the SCRUM Team
- Typically 5-7 people
- Cross-functional
- Members should be full-time
- Teams are self-organized

## SCRUM Ceremonies

### Backlog Refinement Meeting
- Removing [user stories](http://guide.agilealliance.org/guide/stories.html) that no longer appear relevant
- Creating new user stories in response to newly discovered needs
- Re-assessing the relative priority of stories
- Define/Update [acceptance criteria](http://scrummethodology.com/scrum-acceptance-criteria/) for each backlog
- Assigning estimates to stories which have yet to receive one
- Correcting estimates in light of newly discovered information
- [Splitting](http://guide.agilealliance.org/guide/split.html) user stories which are high priority but too coarse-grained to fit in an upcoming [iteration](http://guide.agilealliance.org/guide/iteration.html)

### Sprint Planning
The Sprint planning meeting is a negotiation between the team and the product owner about what the team will do during the sprint.

- **Attendees:** Scrum Team, Scrum Master, Product Owner
- **When:** At the beginning of a sprint
- **Duration:** 2 hours or less per week of sprint duration
- **Outcome:** Sprint Goal and Plan to accomplish work

### Daily Scrum
On each day of a sprint, the team holds a daily scrum meeting to view the sprint progress.

- **Attendees:** Scrum Team, Scrum Master, Product Owner
- **When:** The meeting should be at the same time and place every day
- **Duration:** Not more than 15 minutes
- **Outcome:** Sprint progress, Impediment list if any

### Sprint Review
At the end of each sprint, a sprint review meeting is held. During this meeting, the Scrum team shows what they accomplished during the sprint. Typically, this takes the form of a demo of the new features.

- **Attendees:** Scrum Team, Scrum Master, Product Owner
- **When:** At the end of a sprint
- **Duration:** Time-boxed one hour per week of the sprint
- **Outcome:** Backlog Accept/Reject

### Sprint Retrospective
The sprint retrospective meeting is held at the end of every sprint after the sprint review meeting. The team and Scrum Master meet to discuss what went well and what to improve in the next sprint.

- **Attendees:** Scrum Team, Scrum Master
- **When:** At the end of a Sprint
- **Duration:** Time-boxed for about an hour per week of the sprint duration
- **Outcome:** Continuous improvement plan

## Product Backlog
- *Created and Maintained by Product Owner*
- Set of user stories (*product backlog items, aka PBI*)
- User Stories is an ordered list of ideas for the product, which can come from the product owner, team members, or stakeholders
- Backlogs could be features, bug fixes, documentation, non-functional requirements, etc., needed to deliver the product

## Sprint Backlog
- *Created by Scrum Team*
- List of work the Scrum team must address during the sprint as per priorities set
- Backlogs are broken down into tasks by the Scrum team
- Tasks are picked up by Scrum team members based on their skill set
- This promotes self-organization of the development team and developer buy-in

## Types of Product Backlog Items
- Functional Story
- Spike Story
- Defect/Bug Story
- Non-Functional Story
- Documentation Story
- Infrastructure Story
- Architecture Story
- Technical Debt Story
